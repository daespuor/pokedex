![About Pokemon](../../assets/images/about.jpeg)

The <b >Pokédex</b> (ポケモン図鑑, Pokemon Zukan, lit. "Illustrated Pokémon Encyclopedia") is an electronic device designed
to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon featured in the Pokémon video game,
anime and manga series. The name Pokédex is a neologism including "Pokémon" (which itself is a portmanteau of
"pocket" and "monster") and "index". The Japanese name is simply "Pokémon Encyclopedia", as it can feature every
Pokémon on it, depending on the Pokédex.
